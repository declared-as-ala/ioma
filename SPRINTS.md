# SPRINTS.md — IOMA Paris Dubai

Status legend: `NOT STARTED` · `IN PROGRESS` · `DONE`. This file is kept in sync with `TODO.md` and `PROGRESS.md` — a sprint is `DONE` only when every acceptance criterion is checked in `TODO.md`.

---

## Sprint 0 — Audit & Planning — **DONE** (2026-08-05)

**Objective**: Establish ground truth before writing any product code.

**Tasks**: audit repo (found empty), read `IOMA_CHARTE_GRAPHIQUE_2026_FR.pdf` in full (30 pages), resolve git isolation, write all 15 root docs, confirm toolchain (Node 24 / pnpm 10 / Docker 29 present).

**Acceptance criteria**: all 15 docs exist with real content (no empty stubs); charter colors/typography/logo rules verified and recorded in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`; git repo isolated to `ioma/`.

**Definition of done**: this file, plus `PROGRESS.md`, reflect the above. ✅

---

## Sprint 1 — Foundation — **DONE** (2026-08-05)

**Objective**: A running, dockerized, typed monorepo skeleton with auth foundations — nothing product-specific yet, but real and buildable.

**Tasks**:

- pnpm workspace + Turborepo (`apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/ui|types|validation|config|eslint-config|tsconfig`)
- `apps/web`: Next.js App Router + TS + Tailwind, `[locale]` routing via next-intl scaffold (en/fr/ar)
- `apps/api`: NestJS + Mongoose connection, config module with startup env validation, health endpoint, Swagger
- Docker Compose (dev): mongo, redis, minio, api, web, with healthchecks and named volumes; no host ports on mongo/redis/minio beyond localhost dev convenience
- ESLint + Prettier + Husky + lint-staged, conventional-commit friendly
- Auth foundation: User schema, password hashing, JWT access + rotating refresh token, register/login/refresh/logout endpoints, rate limiting on auth routes

**Technical notes**: shared types flow `packages/types` ← hand-synced from NestJS DTOs for now (OpenAPI-generated client is a Sprint 1 stretch goal, formalized once the first real modules exist in Sprint 4+). Redis used for refresh-token/session storage from day one so Sprint 5+ doesn't need a storage migration.

**Dependencies**: none (first sprint).

**Acceptance criteria**: `docker compose up` brings up all 5 services healthy; `GET /api/health` returns 200; `POST /auth/register` → `/auth/login` → `/auth/refresh` → `/auth/logout` works end to end against a real Mongo instance; `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck` clean across the monorepo.

**Tests**: Jest unit tests for password hashing + token issuance/rotation; one Jest e2e test hitting the four auth endpoints in sequence.

**Status**: DONE — see `PROGRESS.md` Sprint 1 for the full build log and bug list.

---

## Sprint 2 — Design System — **DONE** (2026-08-05)

**Objective**: Every visual primitive the rest of the build depends on, restyled to the IOMA charter — no default shadcn look ships past this sprint.

**Tasks**: Tailwind token config (colors incl. 7 range colors scoped via data-attribute/CSS var, not global Tailwind color slots; type scale; spacing; radii — deliberately small/near-zero per "no excessive rounded corners"; shadows — minimal; motion durations/easing; breakpoints; z-index scale). Font loading strategy (Gotham/Futura PT substitutes via `next/font`). Base shadcn primitives added via shadcn MCP then restyled (button, input, select, dialog, sheet, tabs, accordion, table, calendar, form). Header (transparent-over-hero → solid on scroll), mega-menu navigation, footer, locale switcher, RTL logical-property audit of every primitive.

**Dependencies**: Sprint 1 (Tailwind/Next app must exist).

**Acceptance criteria**: a `/design-system` internal preview route renders every token and restyled primitive in both LTR and RTL, light-mode only (no dark mode requested by client); Lighthouse a11y ≥ 95 on that route; zero default-shadcn-gray components remain.

**Tests**: Vitest component tests for restyled primitives (renders, keyboard nav, RTL mirroring where directional); axe accessibility check in CI on the preview route.

---

## Sprint 3 — Public Luxury Website — **DONE** (2026-08-05)

**Objective**: Every marketing/editorial page live, CMS-editable, in EN/FR/AR.

**Tasks**: Homepage (cinematic hero, philosophy, technology teaser, ranges, shop-by-concern, routine teaser, featured products, results storytelling, treatments teaser, partner teaser, B2B teaser, journal highlights, appointment CTA, newsletter), La Maison IOMA, Our Technology, Treatments + Treatment detail, Journal + Article detail, Professionals landing, Contact, FAQ, legal page shells (privacy/cookies/shipping/returns/T&Cs/accessibility/AI consent) with counsel-pending copy clearly flagged in CMS, not fabricated.

**Dependencies**: Sprint 2.

**Acceptance criteria**: every listed page reachable from nav, renders real (not lorem) editorial copy sourced from CMS seed content, passes responsive check at 1440/1280/1024/768/390, EN/FR/AR-RTL all reviewed.

**Tests**: Playwright smoke test visiting every public route in all 3 locales, checking no console errors and correct `dir` attribute for `ar`.

---

## Sprint 4 — B2C E-commerce — **DONE** (2026-08-06)

**Objective**: Full retail purchase path, mock-payment complete.

**Tasks**: catalogue/category/range/concern browsing, search + filters + sort, PLP with premium cards (hover image, badges), PDP (gallery, variants, ingredients, routine step, related/complete-the-routine), wishlist, cart (mini + full), checkout (guest + logged-in, UAE address w/ emirate/city, delivery method, payment step), payment-provider interface + mock provider + webhook/idempotency plumbing, order creation + status + tracking timeline, order confirmation/failure/retry states.

**Dependencies**: Sprints 1 (auth), 2 (UI), 3 (site shell/nav/footer reused).

**Acceptance criteria**: guest can browse → add to cart → checkout → mock-pay → see confirmation → (if registered) see order in account; admin can see the order (stub list acceptable until Sprint 10 builds full admin).

**Tests**: Playwright E2E "guest checkout happy path" + "mock payment failure/retry" + Jest tests for cart pricing/tax math and idempotent webhook handling.

---

## Sprint 4.5 — Responsive & Mobile Hardening — **DONE** (2026-08-06)

Numbered 4.5, not 5, deliberately — inserted into the existing backlog without renumbering Sprints 5–12 (and every cross-reference to them already written in `TODO.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and prior handoff prompts). Responsiveness was never _absent_ from Sprints 0–4 (every page was built against `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`'s breakpoint scale and spot-checked), but it was never the sole focus of a pass either — this sprint is a dedicated, systematic sweep across everything shipped so far, before the surface area grows further with Sprint 5+.

**Objective**: Every component and every page built in Sprints 0–4 is verified — not assumed — to work correctly at all 5 required breakpoints, in all 3 locales (including AR-RTL), with no horizontal scroll, no overlap/clipping/truncation, no sub-44×44px touch targets, and no desktop-only interaction pattern (hover-only reveals, etc.) that has no mobile equivalent.

**Tasks**:

- Systematic breakpoint sweep at exactly `390 / 768 / 1024 / 1280 / 1440` (`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`'s `sm/md/lg/xl/2xl` scale) across: every `/design-system` primitive, the full public site (homepage, La Maison, Technology, Treatments ×5, Professionals, Contact, FAQ, Journal ×3, all 7 legal pages), and the full Sprint 4 commerce surface (`/shop`, `/shop/[slug]`, `/cart`, `/checkout`'s 3 steps, `/checkout/confirmation/[orderNumber]`, `/wishlist`).
- Fix real defects found, don't just document them: the homepage's tile grids, the PDP's two-column layout collapsing correctly at `md`, the checkout wizard's step indicator not wrapping/overflowing at `390`, the cart drawer's width on narrow viewports, the Header's primary nav (currently `hidden lg:flex` — confirm the mobile equivalent, a menu trigger, actually exists and is reachable, not just hidden with nothing replacing it), table-like layouts (order line items, address cards) reflowing instead of forcing horizontal scroll.
- Confirm every interactive element meets the 44×44px touch-target minimum on touch viewports (`CLAUDE.md` accessibility rule) — icon buttons (`icon-sm`/`icon-xs` variants in `button.tsx`) are the likely offenders, worth auditing directly against the rendered CSS `size-*` values, not assuming.
- Confirm nothing depends on `:hover` alone to reveal necessary content or controls (no touch equivalent) — audit `group-hover:` usage across product cards, nav items, etc.
- AR-RTL at every breakpoint too, not just desktop — logical properties (`ms-`/`me-`/`ps-`/`pe-`) were already audited for correctness in Sprint 2, but never specifically re-checked under narrow-viewport wrapping, where RTL layout bugs most often actually surface.
- Add an automated regression net so this doesn't silently regress as Sprints 5+ land: Playwright viewport-matrix coverage (see Tests below), not just a manual pass that's never re-run.

**Dependencies**: Sprints 0–4 (this sprint audits and fixes what they built; it doesn't add new features).

**Acceptance criteria**: every route live at the time of this sprint renders with zero horizontal overflow and zero clipped/overlapping content at all 5 breakpoints in all 3 locales; every interactive control is ≥44×44px on touch viewports; the Playwright viewport-matrix suite (see below) is green and wired to run alongside the existing a11y/smoke suite, not as a one-off.

**Tests**: extend `apps/web/e2e/public-smoke.spec.ts`'s pattern (or a new `responsive-smoke.spec.ts`) to run each route at each of the 5 breakpoints via Playwright's `page.setViewportSize`, asserting `document.documentElement.scrollWidth <= viewport width` (the cheapest reliable proxy for "nothing is overflowing") plus a handful of targeted assertions (mobile nav trigger is visible and reachable at `390`, checkout step indicator doesn't overflow at `390`, PDP columns actually stack at `md` and below). Manual visual review (screenshots at each breakpoint) for anything the automated checks can't assert structurally.

---

## Sprint 4.6 — Smooth Navigation & Interaction Motion — **DONE** (2026-08-06)

**Objective**: Create a consistent, elegant, fast, and accessible motion system across navigation, header, drawers, menus, dialogs, accordions, tabs, route transitions, and commerce micro-interactions across desktop, tablet, and mobile in EN, FR, and AR (RTL).

**Tasks**:

- Centralize motion tokens (durations 120ms–600ms, standard/entrance/exit/editorial easings, reusable motion variants in `@ioma/web` `lib/motion-tokens.ts`)
- Page navigation continuity & route progress indicator (subtle brand top bar, instant feedback, no flash, back/forward support)
- Header state transition, navigation underline, active route motion, desktop dropdowns
- Mobile navigation drawer, Cart drawer, Search drawer/modal, Filter/Sort panels (backdrop fade, slide/fade, stagger nav items, focus management, body scroll lock, Escape key support)
- Dialogs, dropdowns, popovers, select menus (scale 0.98→1, short opacity, fast exit)
- Accordions & dynamic collapsible content (smooth expansion, dynamic EN/FR/AR height support, chevron rotation)
- Tabs & multi-step flows (active underline/pill indicator, subtle step fade/slide)
- Product gallery & commerce micro-interactions (fade image transitions without layout shift, quantity button feedback, subtle wishlist toggle state, loading skeletons with pulse)
- Toasts & feedback notifications (live regions, short entrance/exit, pause on hover)
- Strict `prefers-reduced-motion` compliance across all components
- Playwright automated motion & accessibility test suite

**Dependencies**: Sprints 0–4.5.

**Acceptance criteria**: Navigation feels smooth without artificial delay; shared layout remains stable; route progress never gets stuck; overlays trap focus, lock body scroll, restore focus on close, and support Escape; reduced-motion mode works; AR RTL directionality is correct; typecheck, lint, build, Docker rebuild, and Playwright test suite pass clean.

**Tests**: Playwright tests for drawer open/close, focus containment, focus restoration, escape key, route progress bar, accordions, dialogs, RTL overlays, and reduced motion.

## Sprint 4.7 — Mobile Bottom Tab Navigation — **DONE** (2026-08-06)

Numbered 4.7 for the same reason as 4.5/4.6 — inserted without renumbering Sprints 5–12. Distinct from 4.5 (which audits/fixes existing responsive layout) and 4.6 (which added the motion system) — this sprint adds a navigation pattern that doesn't exist yet: a persistent, native-app-style bottom tab bar for mobile viewports, alongside (not replacing) the Sprint 4.6 hamburger drawer for full site navigation.

**Objective**: On mobile viewports, the site feels like a real mobile app to navigate — a fixed bottom tab bar with the handful of destinations a returning customer actually needs constantly (Home, Shop, Bag, Wishlist, Account), always reachable in one tap, never requiring the hamburger drawer for routine navigation.

**Tasks**:

- Fixed bottom tab bar (`components/layout/bottom-tab-bar.tsx`), visible only below the `lg` (1024px) breakpoint where the header's primary nav is hidden, `position: fixed`/`sticky` to the viewport bottom, `z-drawer` or higher per `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`'s z-index scale (`--z-drawer 60`) so it never sits under the cart/search drawers incorrectly, but must yield to actual open modals/drawers/toasts.
- 5 tabs: Home (`/`), Shop (`/shop`), Bag (`/cart`, live item-count badge — reuse the existing badge logic in `cart-trigger-button.tsx`), Wishlist (`/wishlist`), Account (`/account` if logged in else `/login` — reuse `account-link.tsx`'s existing logic rather than duplicating it). Each tab: icon + short label, active-tab state (filled icon or accent underline/pill, consistent with the existing header's `layoutId` active-underline pattern from Sprint 4.6), `aria-current="page"` on the active tab.
- Real native-app details, not just 5 icons in a row: safe-area-inset padding for iOS home-indicator (`env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`), a subtle top border/shadow separating it from page content, tap feedback (scale/opacity on press, respecting `prefers-reduced-motion` per the Sprint 4.6 motion-tokens system — reuse `lib/motion-tokens.ts`, don't invent a second motion system), and — critically — **page content must never be hidden behind the bar**: every page needs bottom padding/safe-area accounting equal to the bar's height on mobile viewports (a real, easy-to-miss bug: content or a page's own fixed/sticky footer elements getting obscured).
- Reconcile with what already exists at the bottom of the viewport on mobile: check the checkout page's submit/continue buttons, the PDP's add-to-cart button, and any other page-bottom fixed elements for overlap with the new tab bar and fix any conflicts.
- Hide the bottom tab bar (or don't render it) on routes where it doesn't make sense — the checkout flow is the main candidate (a competing bottom-fixed element, the step navigation, would fight the tab bar for the same screen real estate); use judgment and state the reasoning in `DECISIONS.md`.
- RTL: confirm the tab order and any directional icons mirror correctly under `dir="rtl"`.

**Dependencies**: Sprint 4.6 (motion tokens, active-route detection pattern), Sprint 4.5 (should land after or alongside — this sprint's own Playwright checks should assume 4.5's touch-target/overflow fixes are already in place).

**Acceptance criteria**: bottom tab bar renders on every page below `lg` in all 3 locales, all 5 tabs navigate correctly with accurate active-state, cart badge count matches the real cart, no page content is ever obscured by the bar, 44×44px+ touch targets on every tab, keyboard/screen-reader reachable (not just tap-only), `prefers-reduced-motion` respected, verified live against a rebuilt Docker container at 390px and 768px.

**Tests**: Playwright — bar visible below `lg` / absent at `lg`+, each tab navigates to the right route and shows correct active state, cart badge reflects real cart count after an add-to-cart, no vertical scroll-body overlap between the bar and page content (assert the last focusable/visible element on a long page isn't covered by the bar's bounding box), RTL tab order, reduced-motion.

## Sprint 5 — Customer Account — **DONE** (2026-08-06)

**Objective**: Authenticated customer hub.

**Tasks**: dashboard, profile, addresses CRUD, order history + tracking, wishlist, saved routines, diagnosis/before-after history, appointments list, notifications, language/newsletter preferences, password/security, account deletion request workflow.

**Dependencies**: Sprint 1 auth, Sprint 4 orders/wishlist data to display.

**Acceptance criteria**: every account subsection has real backend-backed CRUD (no static mock data left after this sprint), account deletion request creates an auditable admin-visible record rather than silently deleting.

**Tests**: Jest service tests for profile/address CRUD authorization (a user can never read/write another user's data); Playwright test for the full account navigation.

---

## Sprint 6 — Diagnosis (Standard + AI) — **DONE** (2026-08-06)

**Objective**: Personalized routine engine, both non-AI questionnaire and AI-mock pipeline.

**Tasks**: standard questionnaire UI + admin-managed rules engine (not hardcoded recommendations) producing skin profile → routine; AI flow (consent → privacy notice → upload/camera → quality validation → async job via BullMQ → mock provider analysis → results, clearly labeled simulated → routine → save/compare/delete); AI provider interface with pluggable real-provider adapter point; consent record model; image-retention policy + delete workflow.

**Dependencies**: Sprint 1 (queues/storage foundation), Sprint 4 (routine → cart), Sprint 5 (history storage location).

**Acceptance criteria**: both flows produce a routine that can be added to cart in one action; AI results UI cannot be mistaken for a real medical diagnosis (explicit disclaimer, "simulated" badge while mock provider active); user can delete their analysis images/results and the underlying MinIO objects are actually removed.

**Tests**: Jest tests for the rules engine (given inputs → expected recommendation) and consent-gating (no analysis proceeds without a recorded consent); Playwright E2E for both diagnosis flows.

---

## Sprint 7 — Partners & Booking — **DONE** (2026-08-07)

**Objective**: Locate a partner, book a real slot, no double-booking.

**Tasks**: partner locator (map + list, OSM/Leaflet default provider behind a map-provider interface, filters by emirate/city/type/service/diagnosis availability), partner detail page, availability model (working hours, breaks, holidays, capacity, service duration), booking wizard (service → diagnosis/treatment → specialist → date/slot → details → confirm), reschedule/cancel with policy, reminder job.

**Dependencies**: Sprint 1 (queues for reminders), Sprint 6 (diagnosis/treatment selection step reuses that data).

**Acceptance criteria**: booking the last available slot for a resource makes it unavailable to a second concurrent booking attempt (server-enforced, not just UI-disabled); map renders with zero API key required by default.

**Tests**: Jest test simulating concurrent booking requests for the same slot (only one succeeds); Playwright E2E full booking → reschedule → cancel.

**Status**: DONE — see `PROGRESS.md` Sprint 7 for the full build log.

---

## Sprint 8 — B2B — **DONE**

**Objective**: Professional registration through to a live, luxuriously-designed ordering portal.

**Tasks**: application form (company/trade licence/docs upload to private MinIO), application state machine (draft → submitted → pending → docs requested → approved/rejected/suspended), admin manual approval flow, professional dashboard (pricing, cabin + retail catalogue, MOQs, quick order, professional cart/checkout, orders/reorder, invoices, documents, protocols/technical sheets, marketing materials, company settings, team members).

**Dependencies**: Sprint 1 (auth/RBAC), Sprint 4 (cart/checkout patterns reused with a professional price list + MOQ layer).

**Acceptance criteria**: an unapproved professional cannot see B2B pricing or place an order (server-enforced); admin approval/rejection/suspension actually flips portal access; portal visually distinct from generic admin/SaaS chrome (uses the same luxury design system as the public site, denser layout).

**Tests**: Jest authorization tests for every professional-portal endpoint across all account states (pending/approved/suspended/rejected); Playwright E2E registration → (simulated) admin approval → professional login → order.

---

## Sprint 9 — Training & Protocols — **DONE (2026-08-13)**

**Objective**: Training catalogue + booking + protocol library for approved professionals.

**Tasks**: training catalogue (session model reusing Sprint 7 availability/capacity primitives), booking + payment-when-required + confirmation/invitation download, training history, cancellation policy, certificate download when supplied; protocol library (title/objective/duration/products/steps/contraindications/PDF/video/related training) with permission-gated access.

**Dependencies**: Sprint 7 (scheduling primitives), Sprint 8 (professional gating).

**Acceptance criteria**: a non-professional account cannot see or book training; protocol PDFs/videos served via signed MinIO URLs, never public.

**Tests**: Jest tests for capacity limits (can't overbook a session) and permission gating on protocol access; Playwright E2E training booking.

---

## Sprint 10 — Administration — **DONE (2026-08-13)**

**Objective**: One dashboard to run the whole business.

**Tasks**: KPI dashboard; modules for products/categories/ranges/concerns/ingredients/variants/media/inventory/B2C+B2B pricing, customers, professionals + approvals, orders/payments/refunds/shipments, partners/locations/services/treatments, appointments/availability, trainings/attendees, protocols/documents, diagnostics/AI analyses, content/pages/journal/FAQ/translations/SEO, promotions, notifications/email templates, users/roles/permissions, settings, audit logs. Consistent search/filter/sort/pagination/bulk actions/confirmation dialogs/all-4-states pattern across every module (built once as a shared admin-table primitive, reused everywhere — not rebuilt per module).

**Dependencies**: Sprints 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (admin manages entities they create).

**Acceptance criteria**: every entity created by every prior sprint is fully manageable (create/read/update/appropriate-delete) from admin; RBAC enforced server-side per module, not just hidden nav items; audit log records who changed what.

**Tests**: Jest authorization matrix tests per role × module; Playwright E2E for the professional-approval and product-CRUD admin flows specifically (highest business risk).

---

## Sprint 11 — Localization & Quality — **DONE (2026-08-13)**

**Objective**: Close every EN/FR/AR-RTL, accessibility, performance, and SEO gap opened by Sprints 3–10.

**Tasks**: full string audit (zero untranslated keys), AR-RTL pass on every screen built so far (forms, tables, checkout, account, B2B, admin-where-enabled), hreflang + sitemap + robots + OG + schema (Product/Article/LocalBusiness/FAQ/Organization), Core Web Vitals pass, security header/CSP pass.

**Dependencies**: everything before it (this sprint audits, not builds, new features).

**Acceptance criteria**: no untranslated string found in an EN/FR/AR crawl of every route; Lighthouse SEO ≥ 95, a11y ≥ 95, performance targets met on the homepage/PDP/checkout; security checklist in `SECURITY.md` fully checked.

**Tests**: automated i18n key-coverage check in CI; Lighthouse CI budget; axe CI sweep.

---

## Sprint 12 — Testing & Deployment — **DONE (2026-08-13)**

**Objective**: Ship-ready.

**Tasks**: complete the Playwright journey suite (all journeys from §35 of the brief), production Docker Compose + Nginx/Caddy TLS-ready config, GitHub Actions CI (lint/typecheck/test/build/docker build), backup/restore scripts (Mongo dump, MinIO bucket sync), rollback documentation, final QA pass across the 5 breakpoints × 3 locales × the state matrix in `TEST_PLAN.md`.

**Dependencies**: all prior sprints.

**Acceptance criteria**: `docker compose -f infrastructure/docker/compose.prod.yml up` builds and serves the full app; CI green on a clean clone; every item in `DEPLOYMENT.md`'s go-live checklist ticked or explicitly logged as a pending client-provided credential.

**Tests**: full Playwright suite green; production Docker build succeeds with zero TypeScript errors.
