# Uses Turborepo's `prune` command to build a minimal, correct build context
# for a single app out of the monorepo — the standard pattern for
# pnpm + Turborepo, and far less fragile than hand-picking which
# node_modules directories to copy across stages (workspace packages have
# their own node_modules with symlinks into the root pnpm store; copying
# them selectively silently breaks resolution — see DECISIONS.md incident
# notes for how this went wrong the first time).
